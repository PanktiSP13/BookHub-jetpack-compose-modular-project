# BookHub

The **BookHub** project is a demo application that showcases modern Android development practices, including **MVI architecture**, **Clean Architecture principles**, **network calls with Retrofit**, **Hilt for dependency injection**.

---

- Developed using a **declarative approach** with Jetpack Compose.
- Designed for the **latest Android SDK 35** and **Kotlin 2.0** with the Compose compiler.

## Features

### **Modularized Architecture**

The app is modularized into three distinct layers for better scalability and maintainability:
- **Data module**: Responsible for managing API calls and local data storage.

- **Domain module**: Contains business logic.

- **Presentation module**: Handles UI rendering and user interactions.

**Architecture Pattern** : Implemented **Model-View-Intent (MVI)** architecture pattern to maintain a unidirectional data flow and predictable state management.
**Clean Architecture Principles** : Follows Clean Architecture principles to ensure modularity, scalability, and a clear separation of layers.
**Network Calls**: Network calls are managed using **Retrofit**. Includes a **common method for safe API calls** to handle errors and responses efficiently.
**Dependency Injection** : **Hilt** is used for dependency injection, making it easy to provide and inject dependencies throughout the app.
**Image Handling** : Used **Coil** for asynchronous image loading & a **common image picker** with robust permission handling.
**Reactive Programming** : Used  **Kotlin Flow** for reactive and asynchronous data streams.
**Dependency Management** : All dependencies are managed using a centralized **TOML** file for better maintainability.
**KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing)** is used over **KAPT** for improved build performance.


### Prerequisites
- **Android Studio Koala ** or later (Used Android studio Ladybug).
- **JDK 17**.
- A device/emulator running Android 7.0 (API level 24) or higher.
